## Assessment Task

Your task is to:

1. **Dockerize** the frontend and backend applications.
2. Use **Terraform** to provision a local Kubernetes cluster.
3. Write **Kubernetes manifests** to deploy both applications.
4. Set up a **Jenkins pipeline** to automate build and deployment.
5. Configure **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to expose the services.
6. **Document** your setup and approach in `DOCS.md`.
